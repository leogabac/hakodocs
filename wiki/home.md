# Welcome to HakoDocs!
HakoDocs is a public compilation of tech-related notes that address specific problems I've encountered throughout my life.
You can expect to find _How to do $$X$$_ guides for a variety of topics, primarily related to Linux, programming languages, servers, and more.
I started this project as a personal collection of notes, and as I began sharing them with my colleagues, it grew into something more.
The same colleagues these notes once helped started contributing to them. I hope you, like them, find something useful within this _hako_.

> Many of the content in these notes is centered around Arch Linux as that is my daily driver distribution.


## Why HakoDocs?

For some reason, [leogabac](https://github.com/leogabac) (the creator) is obsessed with VTubers, so he tries to include references in all of his projects. In this case, _HakoDocs_ is a wordplay on multiple levels:

- Since most of these wiki pages are somewhat _chaotic_ to organize, _Hako_ primarily references [_Hakos Baelz_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmPnx-EEeOrZSg5Tiw7ZRQ) from [Hololive English Promise](https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en/talents?gp=promise), the embodiment of chaos. The word _Docs_ was added since this project is primarily for documentation.
- The word _hako_ means _box_ in Japanese, symbolizing that this wiki is a "box" of documentation.
- It could also be read as _Hack o' Docs_, giving it a hacker-esque feel.
