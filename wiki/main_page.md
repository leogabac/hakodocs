# Welcome to HakoDocs!
HakoDocs is a public compilation of tech-related notes that address specific problems I've encountered throughout my life.
You can expect to find _How to do $$X$$_ guides for a variety of topics, primarily related to Linux, programming languages, servers, and more.
I started this project as a personal collection of notes, and as I began sharing them with my colleagues, it grew into something more.
The same colleagues these notes once helped started contributing to them. I hope you, like them, find something useful within this _hako_.
