# Arch Linux

Arch Linux is a _rolling-release_ distribution, i.e.  _packages_ (software) receive updates constantly. There is not a concensus on how often one needs to update their system, a good rule of thumb is once per week.

> __PRO TIP:__  
> If case something happens, __always__ check the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) first. It always help, no matter the problem you may have. Read __very__ carefully the instructions, and don't skip steps. I have encountered many problems for literally not reading the next line in the wiki.

This guide serves as both a beginner guide to know that to check after they install Arch Linux for the first time, but also a checklist for myself to remember what to look for in a new installation. I will assume that you installed KDE Plasma as your Desktop Environment.

## The package Manager

As in any Linux distribution, Arch Linux has a _package manager_ called `pacman` that installs software from the _Arch repository_ . Package names may differ from other distributions, so it is recommended that you check on the [repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/) or the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) how to install particular software.

To install packages simply run
```bash
sudo pacman -S PACKAGE_NAME
```
where the `-S` flag stands for _Sync_. It basically reads 

> Sync from the pacman (Arch) repository PACKAGE_NAME with my system

## The Arch User Repository
Not every piece of software can be found in the regular Arch repositories. Take for example `dropbox`, that has official support for Debian/Ubuntu, but not for Arch Linux. Another example would be software that need to be _compiled from source_ like `lammps`, `gromacs` or some of the `xp-pen` drivers for their tablets. Manually repackaging, or compiling from source will install the software on your system at the cost of not being properly managed by `pacman`. On such cases we turn to the so-called _Arch User Repository_ (AUR).

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community-driven repository for Arch Linux that allows users to share and install packages not available in the official Arch repositories. Unlike the official repos, which provide precompiled binaries, the AUR contains _PKGBUILD_ scripts—text files that define how to download, compile, and install software from source or external sources like .deb packages. Users can manually download a PKGBUILD and run `makepkg -si` to build and install the package, or use an _AUR helper_ like `yay` or `paru` to automate the process. Since AUR packages are maintained by the community, they are not officially supported by Arch and may require user intervention if dependencies or builds break.

To install `yay` as an AUR helper, run
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
mkdir /tmp/yay
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git /tmp/yay
cd /tmp/yay
makepkg -si
```
Then from the AUR, we can install with same flags as in `pacman`
```
yay -S PACKAGE_NAME
```
When yay installs an AUR package, it first downloads the _PKGBUILD_ script, builds the package into a `.pkg.tar.zst` file, and then installs it using `pacman -U`. Since pacman tracks all installed packages in its local database (/var/lib/pacman/), the AUR package becomes indistinguishable from an official package in terms of management. This means `pacman -Q` can list it, `pacman -R` can remove it, and `pacman -U` can reinstall it. 

Because AUR packages are not in the official repositories, `pacman -Syu` does not update them—users must manually rebuild them or use an AUR helper like `yay -Syu`, which automates the update process by fetching new _PKGBUILD_ versions and repeating the build-and-install process.

## Full System Upgrade
Arch Linux receives constant updates, to make a _full system upgrade_ run
```
sudo pacman -Syu
```
> __WARNING:__
> Always make sure to read what packages are being updated.


# System Sanity Check 
First thing, is that we need to check if all basic functionalities are working properly. In some sections I don't have any particular advice, as they usually work out of the box. In such cases, I will simply provide a link to their ArchWiki page.

## Network
Check [Network configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration/Wireless) on the ArchWiki.

## Sound
Check [Sound system](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sound_system) on the ArchWiki.

## Bluetooth

Some extra packages will be necessary.

```bash
sudo pacman -S bluez bluez-utils bluez-deprecated-tools
```

Typically the Bluetooth Services is not enabled by default.

```bash
sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
```

Sometimes you will need to reboot your PC for everything to work properly.

### Sound through Bluetooth
Check [Bluetooth headset](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bluetooth_headset) on the ArchWiki.

## Keyboard Backlight
The frontend that controls the backlight is not installed.

```
sudo pacman -S brightnessctl
```
If that does not solve it, check [Keyboard backlight](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_backlight) on the Archwiki.

## Screenshots
The software that takes screenshots is not installed. For KDE Plasma use `spectacle`.

```bash
sudo pacman -S spectacle
```

## Monitors
In particular,
1. All monitors connect correctly, in particular those that use Thunderbolt/USB4.
2. All monitors run at their respective refresh rate.

## Graphics Card
There are a few ways to make sure your dedicated graphics card is working. 

### Card Is Detected
1. In KDE Plasma, look for the _About_ setting, it should list all of your components.
2. Using fastfetch
```bash
sudo pacman -S fastfetch
fastfech
```
3. Using `lspci`
```bash
lspci | grep -i vga
```

### OpenGL Renderer
You can check the default OpenGL rendered for your system to make sure which card is currently being used
```bash
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"
```
> OpenGL renderer string: AMD Radeon RX 6650M (radeonsi, navi23, LLVM 19.1.6, DRM 3.59, 6.12.9-arch1-1)

This will list the current renderer and used driver. If it is not the correct one, you can force it with the `DRI_PRIME` environment variable.
```bash
DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"
```
> OpenGL renderer string: AMD Radeon 780M (radeonsi, gfx1103_r1, LLVM 19.1.6, DRM 3.59, 6.12.9-arch1-1)

As a final sanity check, a good way to _really_ make sure your card is working is by launching minecraft. You can install it from the AUR
```
yay -S minecraft-launcher
```
In a world, press F3 and check the _display_ information on the right side. If you see the incorrect graphics card, change Plasma to use the other one as default, or force the application launcher to use the correct `DRI_PRIME` variable state.

I am not sure on how this is configured, typically after a few restards, Plasma always decides to use the dedicated graphics.

# Text Editor

## VSCode
There are many text editors on Linux. VSCode is a Microsoft editor with enabled telemetry, Linux users do not like that for privacy concerns. VSCodium is a community open-source release that nullifies telemetry, and is available in the AUR. For Arch Linux, there is an official OSS release
```bash
sudo pacman -S code
```
For more information, read the [VSCode Arch Wiki Page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Visual_Studio_Code).

## Neovim
I personally use `nvim` with my own configuration.
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvim
git clone https://github.com/leogabac/leovim.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```
Check the [leovim repository](https://github.com/leogabac/leovim) for more information.
