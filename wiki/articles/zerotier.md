# ZeroTier

ZeroTier is a software-defined networking (SDN) solution that enables secure and decentralized virtual networking. It allows devices to connect as if they were on the same local network, regardless of their physical location. ZeroTier combines the benefits of VPNs and SD-WANs, offering easy setup, high performance, and end-to-end encryption. It is widely used for remote access, IoT, gaming, and private networking without complex firewall or port forwarding configurations.
